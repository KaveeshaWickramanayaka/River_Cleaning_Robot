The River Cleaning Robot is an autonomous system designed to address the increasing problem of water pollution. Equipped with a range of sensors and a waste collection system, this robot is capable of efficiently removing floating debris, such as plastics, organic waste, and industrial pollutants, from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Powered by rechargeable batteries and controlled via an Arduino Uno, the robot operates in an eco-friendly and cost-effective manner. It can navigate autonomously through water bodies, detect obstacles, and collect waste, providing a sustainable solution for cleaning our waterways.


Key Features:
The robot is designed to collect floating debris autonomously, using ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and waste in the water. It operates on rechargeable batteries, making it both energy-efficient and eco-friendly. The system is controlled by an Arduino Uno, which ensures that the robot functions in a cost-effective way. The robot's waste collection system uses a shovel mechanism that picks up floating trash, including plastics, organic matter, and industrial waste.


Key Components:

Ultrasonic Sensor (HCSR04): The HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor plays a crucial role in detecting obstacles and measuring distances to floating debris. This allows the robot to avoid collisions and navigate through the water efficiently, ensuring that it can reach waste and collect it without obstruction.

L298N Motor Driver with H-Bridge: The L298N motor driver controls the DC motors used for the robot's movement. This motor driver allows the robot to move forward, backward, and adjust its direction, ensuring smooth navigation across the water surface for effective waste collection.

DC Motors: The DC motors provide the robot's movement and propulsion capabilities. These motors help the robot navigate the water and control the shovel mechanism, enabling it to collect floating waste.

Buzzer: The robot is equipped with a buzzer that provides feedback to the user. It alerts the user to important system statuses such as successful waste collection, warnings, or issues requiring attention.

Arduino Uno: The Arduino Uno serves as the brain of the robot. It manages all components, processes data from the sensors, and ensures that the robot operates autonomously to clean water bodies.
